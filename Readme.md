Polynomialc
==========

Polynomialc is a heavily templated C++ class for polynomials.  It provides functionality for polynomial algebra (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) as well as root-finding using either the numerically-accurate companion matrix method or the much faster Sturm sequences method.  It supports both statically-sized and dynamically-sized polynomials.

Wherever possible, Polynomialc avoids for loops and instead uses template patterns for statically sized vectors to maximize speed.

Dependencies
------------

Polynomialc depends on the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) linear algebra package.

Install
-------

Polynomialc is a pure template library so no compilation is needed.  However, a CMake file is provided for installing the headers and compiling the test program.

Usage Example
-------------

    #include <Polynomialc/Polynomialc.hpp>

    Eigen::Matrix<double,6,1> acoeffs;
    acoeffs << 1,2,3,4,5,6;
    Polynomialc<5> a( acoeffs );
    
    Eigen::Matrix<double,5,1> bcoeffs;
    bcoeffs << 1,2,3,4,5;
    Polynomialc<4> b( bcoeffs );

    Polynomialc<9> c = a*b;
    std::vector<double> roots = c.realRoots();

Todo
----

Allow for choice of float or double.

Allow for adjustable number of bisections in Sturm sequences root finding (determines precision).

Improve the computation of lower and upper root bounds.

Add support for lazy evaluation as in the Eigen library.
